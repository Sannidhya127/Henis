Project: Infixio — The Esoteric Language of Pure Infix Logic
Infixio takes programming’s love of clear, structured logic and puts it into one elegant, terrifying form: pure infix notation. It's like you've harnessed a mathematical proof as your language, only to realize that you are the one who needs to prove you can understand it. Let's go over everything you need to make this language as usable (or not) as possible.

Core Concepts and Syntax
1. Everything is Infix:
Variables, assignments, functions, loops, conditionals—all written as infix expressions.
No prefix (like if (condition)), no suffix (like postfix stacks). Everything is a direct arg1 OP arg2 form.
2. Operators Everywhere:
You’ll need a series of custom operators, each symbolized by various ASCII symbols (+, -, =, ->, etc.), representing logical, arithmetic, and control operations.
Operators are the keys to flow control, variable manipulation, and function calls.
3. Variable Assignments:
Simple assignments use an infix =:
plaintext
Copy code
total = 0
count = 10
Multiple assignments stack, like:
plaintext
Copy code
a = 3 + 4 -> b = a * 2
4. Conditionals:
Conditionals use a condition = if condition then true_val else false_val.
For example:
plaintext
Copy code
result = if x > 5 then 1 else 0
This translates to a traditional if-else but requires clarity in variable use. The if, then, and else are just operators, allowing you to string conditions together.
5. Loops:
Infixio loops are expressions, too! A typical loop uses the form:
plaintext
Copy code
action until condition
Example: a loop to increment i until it’s greater than 10:
plaintext
Copy code
i += 1 until i > 10
Another loop style could iterate a function:
plaintext
Copy code
print i while i < 10
6. Functions as Operators:
Functions take the form of infix operators:
-> for simple pass-to-function calls.
->> for chained function calls.
plaintext
Copy code
result = sqrt a -> log result
Functions are small, reusable expressions with input/output done via stack assignments.
Language Details
1. Operators and Their Purpose
Operator	Purpose	Example
=	Assignment	x = 5
+	Addition	total = a + b
*	Multiplication	total = a * b
if	Conditional start	x = if condition then 1 else 0
then	Part of conditional	y = if x > 10 then 100 else 50
else	Part of conditional	if x = 0 then y else z
+=	Increment assignment	count += 1 until count > 10
while	Loop (while condition is true)	i += 1 while i < max
->	Pass result to function	result = sqrt a -> log result
until	Loop until condition is met	print x until x > 100
<=>	Swap	a <=> b
2. Parsing and Execution Logic
Parser:

Split the code into tokens (operators, operands, etc.) and process everything left to right.
Use a stack to maintain the variable state and manage nested expressions.
Execution Model:

The interpreter reads infix commands one by one.
Variables, functions, and control flow manipulate a single stack, meaning the execution order is strictly linear.
Control Flow:

For loops and conditionals, operators like if, then, else, while, and until handle the flow.
Nested structures aren’t allowed, so users must create sequences of simple if-then checks, making code minimalistic but challenging.
3. Stack-Based Variable Management
Each variable assignment and operation is pushed onto a stack, and assignments are handled within the stack scope. Here’s what this looks like in practice:

plaintext
Copy code
a = 5
b = a + 3
result = if b > 5 then a else b
This stack-based execution is what lets users execute simple programs without overloading the memory.

Sample Programs
1. Fibonacci Sequence
Prints the first 10 Fibonacci numbers:

plaintext
Copy code
a = 0
b = 1
count = 0
print a -> b while count < 10
next = a + b
a <=> b -> count += 1
2. Prime Checker
A program to check if a number is prime:

plaintext
Copy code
n = 29
i = 2
is_prime = true
is_prime = if n % i = 0 then false else is_prime while i < n / 2
print is_prime
Building Infixio: The Essentials
Tokenization:

Build a tokenizer to read and parse symbols, numbers, and operators.
Map each symbol to a dictionary with its operation for efficient lookup.
Interpreter:

Implement a basic infix parser with a stack to manage state and variables.
Evaluate expressions line-by-line using standard infix parsing with precedence for operators (if, then, etc.).
Error Handling:

Since Infixio is prone to syntactical errors (given its reliance on strict infix), build error messages that hint at invalid syntax or missing operators.
Why Infixio is Brilliantly Nerdy
Novelty with Practicality: Infix notation for everything makes it more readable than esolangs like Brainf*ck but retains enough eccentricity to be a fun challenge.
Extreme Minimalism: By having no structure other than infix operations, it forces you to be resourceful and strategic with simple operations.
Programming Meets Mathematics: Infixio isn’t just a language—it’s a programming exercise that feels like solving algebraic puzzles.
There you have it—Infixio: a project that’s equal parts brain-teaser and programming language, the kind of thing that makes seasoned coders go, “Whoa, that’s clever.” And it’s simple enough to build and complex enough to be fun for anyone looking to escape traditional syntax.
